ex0: 
analyse generated sample with MC-tester
to report what is events composition (decay channels).
In root files monitoring histograms for invariant masses
of decay products. 
###############
To execute (after intialising environemtal variables,
see README in deirectory example):

make
./test_ex0.exe <input_file>

Executable print information and summary status.
Histograms from default analysis with MC-Tester stored in 
mc-tester.root 


Spin weight calculated by TauSpinner is alwasy calculated,
if the flag

#define _SPIN_VALIDATION_ONLY_

is used, weight is not propagated to the histograms filled
by MC-Tester.
