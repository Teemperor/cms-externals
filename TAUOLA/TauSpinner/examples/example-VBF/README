This directory includes programs:
-- # example-VBF.cxx            on how the reweigting can be invoked.
                                An example output is included: example-VBF.out
   # read_particles_for_VBF.cxx includes code for reading the event from HepMC 
                                to make invocation possible. Its use is 
				restricted to the case when parton level hard 
				process 2--> 4 is written only. Tau decay 
				products present and intermediade bosons 
				absent (or present). WARNING: user is expected
				to replace this code with his own, adopted
				to real event complexity. However there is 
				no need for incoming parton momenta and 
				outgoing partons can be (are expected to be)
				the four momenta of jets.
				read_particles_for_VBF.cxx is prepared to work 
				with files form MadGraph. That is why, 
				on flight decays of taus with tauola, 
				are provided. Check/adaptation for HepMC events 
				to be in GeV units is performed
-- # lhef-to-hepmc.cxx		simple translator from LHE to HepMC format
-- # ../../src/VBF/vbftests.cxx example, with implemented reweighting 
     				between groups of parton level processes.
				Some of them used for plots of paper:
