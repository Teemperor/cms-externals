This is the README file for the FFTJet package. The main purpose of
this package is reconstruction of particle jets in High Energy Physics
collider data using a two-step approach: first, pattern recognition is
performed, possibly using multiple resolution scales in the eta-phi
space, and then jet energies are reconstructed using preclusters found
during the pattern recognition stage. The code is capable of very
efficient searching for jet-like structures in the event energy flow
pattern. It presents the results using a hierarchical clustering
tree convenient for subsequent signal/background discrimination
studies.

The INSTALL file describes a typical installation procedure for the
package. The code documentation can be found in the "doc" directory,
the user manual is in the file "fftjet_manual.pdf".
