In order to install the FFTJet package without any modifications, you
will first need to make sure that the double precision version of the
FFTW library from www.fftw.org is installed on your system.

Set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the name of the directory
where FFTW library installs its "fftw3.pc" file (usually, this directory
is /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ).

After this, a typical FFTJet installation can proceed as follows:

./configure --with-pic
make
make install

The last step may have to be performed as root. Run

./configure --help

to view available configuration options. After you have performed these
steps, it may be useful to run

make check

to make sure that the example programs provided with the package can be
executed.
