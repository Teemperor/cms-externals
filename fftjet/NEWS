Version 1.5.1 - July 17 2014, by I. Volobouev

* More fixes for the clang compiler.


Version 1.5.0 - May 05 2014, by I. Volobouev

* Added the code for calculating cluster split and merge "times", weighted
  by the local transverse energy fraction.

* Fixes for the clang compiler.


Version 1.4.2 - September 30 2013, by I. Volobouev

* Updated file "examples/processResults.cc" (removed a local unused
  typedef about which g++ issues a warning these days).

* Package build tools updated.


Version 1.4.1 - May 20 2013, by I. Volobouev

* Updated Pythia in "examples/generator" to version 6.4.27.

* Updated example generator so that it can generate flat spectra
  both in Pt and in log(Pt).


Version 1.4.0 - November 26 2012, by I. Volobouev

* Fixed a number of cases where some variable is set but not used.
  This addresses complaints from recent g++ compiler versions.

* Updated some template-based code in FasterKernelRecombinationAlg.icc
  to ensure compliance with stricter template name resolution rules in
  recent g++ compiler versions.

* Package build tools updated.


Version 1.3.2 - April 5 2012, by I. Volobouev

* Package build tools updated, no changes to the code itself


Version 1.3.1 - July 15 2010, by I. Volobouev

* Added read/write operations to the Grid2d class.

* Changed read/write operations for all persistent classes so that they
  use istream/ostream instead of ifstream/ofstream.


Version 1.3.0 - June 29 2010, by I. Volobouev

* Added methods "nClustersAboveMagS2Threshold" and "getMagS2OptimalNodes"
  to the SparseClusteringTree class.

* Changed the way ClusteringSequencer and ConstScaleReconstruction use
  peak selectors. They can now use simpler functor objects. As a result,
  same code can interface peak selectors for the ClusteringSequencer and
  for clustering trees to some interpretive system.

* Added recoScaleRatio member to the Peak, setScaleRatio method to the
  ScaleSpaceKernel, and ratio-setting code to the energy recombination
  algorithms. It is now trivial to implement eta dependence of the shape
  for the jet membership functions.

* Added "convergenceDistance_" member with corresponding access methods
  to the "RecombinedJet" class. Also added the "setPrecluster" method.

* Changed the "less" operator of "Peak" to compare by magnitude times
  scale squared.

* Added "operator==" to the Grid2d class.

* Added "scaleData" function to the Grid2d class which multiplies the
  data by an eta-dependent factor.


Version 1.2.0 - June 20 2010, by I. Volobouev

* Changed the OpenDX visualization format so that it now includes
  the run number

* Fixed a few comparisons of signed and unsigned integers in the
  I/O-related functions


Version 1.1.2 - June 16 2010, by I. Volobouev

* Added typedefs for functor arguments in "SimpleFunctors.hh".

* Added facilities for sparsifying the clustering trees (with
  automatic bifurcation point avoidance)

* A significant bug is fixed in the "closestNonDescendant" method
  of "AbsClusteringTree" class

* Added the "PeakEtaDependentDistance" class -- an eta-dependent metric
  in the eta-phi space


Version 1.1.1 - April 9 2010, by I. Volobouev

* Added checks for self-assignment in all "operator=" implementations.


Version 1.1.0 - March 14 2010, by I. Volobouev

* Added "sequential convolvers" -- the ability to perform Fourier
  transforms separately in each eta bin. This can be useful if the
  jet shape changes depending on eta, as expected in the presence
  of magnetic field and for wall/plug calorimeters. The new classes
  are "SequentialConvolver" and "FrequencySequentialConvolver".
  These classes use 1-d kernels which have been added as well.


Version 1.0.6 - Sep 12 2009, by I. Volobouev

* A few small fixes not visible to the user (removed couple comparisons
  of signed to unsigned integers, included <algorithm> header into
  AbsClusteringTree.icc for compatibility with gcc 4.4, and couple
  other minor fixes).


Version 1.0.5 - June 23 2009, by I. Volobouev

* Added the eta-phi correlation coefficient to the "RecombinedJet" class
  and modified the recombination algorithms to calculate this coefficient.


Version 1.0.4 - June 19 2009, by I. Volobouev

* Added correct "#include" statements to the "FrequencyKernelConvolver.hh"
  header file.

* Made a few improvements to the user manual.


Version 1.0.3 - June 11 2009, by I. Volobouev

* Added jet recombination API for data represented by collections of
  4-vectors

* The functors used to implement the noise/unclustered energy membership
  functions now inherit from Functor2<double,double,BgData> instead
  of Functor2<double,Real,BgData>.


Version 1.0.2 - May 27 2009, by I. Volobouev

* Anisotropic diffusion causes problems in "DiscreteGauss2d" for all
  gamma values except 0 (the reasons are not trivial). So, the gamma
  is no longer a parameter -- it is forced to be 0.

* Detailed formula for the "DiscreteGauss2d" class is now in the manual.


Version 1.0.1 - May 25 2009, by I. Volobouev

* Removed header "FrequencyKernels.hh" -- this was an old attemps to write
  a separate functor for subgaussian distributions. Use RealFrequencyKernel
  together with "SubGauss" class to get this functionality.

* Added class "DiscreteGauss2d". This is the Gaussian kernel corrected
  for the binning effects. Very useful at small scales.

* Added class "FrequencyKernelConvolver" which can be used to memoize
  convolutions with a kernel defined in the frequency domain.
